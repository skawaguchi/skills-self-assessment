# Skills Self-Assessment

I was shown this tool while discussing software craftsmanship across IBM. I thought it would be an interesting exercise to see where I might stand myself, and also to use for my mentees in our 1:1s.

## Current Areas of Development

- [ ] **Foundation**: Continue to get back-end hands-on experience, specifically more Go, gRPC, and especially databases. Improve my system design skills and align to software architecture knowledge. Continue growth with highly-distributed, high-traffic systems.
- [ ] **Servers**: Build and deploy microservices and serverless from scratch. Learn and apply GitOps.
- [ ] **Supporting**: Learn how to make game-changing impacts and grow my skills so I can contribute to the same degree as staff engineers and senior developers in a truly generative organization.
  
## Medium Engineering Growth Rubric

*Last Updated: Sep 1, 2023*

*Previous Update: January 31, 2021*

Refer to Medium's [Engineering growth: Introduction](https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework/engineering-growth-framework-overview-4e02ab330524) for more details. Here is the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EO-Dbsayn8Nz9Ii3MKcwRbt-EIJ2MjQdpoyhh0tBdZk/edit). I also forked and got the [Medium Snowflow](https://snowflake-blond.vercel.app/#1,3,3,2,4,3,4,3,3,2,3,3,4,2,3,3,Stephen%20Kawaguchi,Principal%20Engineer) tool running on Vercel, which I've found to be a really valuable tool. If you want to use it, just modify the URL query string parameters. It can give you an idea of how the metrics work (although Medium itself has [evolved past using it](https://medium.engineering/engineering-growth-at-medium-4935b3234d25)). 

| Skill | Milestone | Points | Justification |
| :---- | --------: | -----: | ------------- |
| **Build** |
| **Mobile** | 1 | 1 | Experience with IBM Cognos React Native app deployed as iOS and Android. I did significant refactoring, but my focus was success with Continuous Delivery and I didn't have much hands-on experience with low-level mobile features.  |
| **Web Client** | 3 | 6 | 20+ experience with web clients. Strong JavaScript knowledge, along with SPAs. Low-level performance optimization. **Update:** (-1/-6 Sep 2023) I've been away from this part of the stack for a while, and have noticed that I'm not up to date with important updates, so I've dropped my score here. | 
| **Foundation** | 3 | 6 | I've architected systems through major upgrades, including adjusting the architecture for better maintainability and extensibility. I've helped debug hard problems in all systems, including difficult optimizations. I've designed medium-complexity web apps. I'm still learning system design and particularly some distributed systems. However, I believe I know microservices architecture fairly well. |
| **Servers** | 2 | 3 | Recently, I've shifted to a back-end-heavy position and have been working with Go and some Rails. I'm not comfortable enough to have earned a higher score, yet. Previously, although I was primarily front-end, I had years of experience adjusting existing server-side code from ASP Classic, ASP.NET, Java, JSP, JSF, and Rails. |
| *Sub-Total* | 9 | **16** |  (-1/-6 Sep 2023) |
| **Executing** |
| **Project Management** | 4 | 12 | 4 yrs/eng. manager + 2 yrs/eng. director + ~6 yrs/responsible tech leader. I was torn on this grade, but my PM seemingly has remained intact as I've had to leverage these skills even as a non-manager. On top of that, I've had to learn how to lead via influence vs. direct responsibility. For example, I've been unfortunate enough to coordinate ungodly levels of cross-team communication (4 teams on average, up to 30+ teams) and complex delivery. I've continued my study of leadership and management principles. I'm constantly looking to find ways to incrementally deliver high-quality software that meets product objectives using SixSigma, Lean, Agile, and DevOps processes, principles. Furthermore, I'm constantly working to establish these as cultural norms because they fundamentally support project delivery and lead to learning organizations with generative outcomes. |  
| **Communication** | 3 | 6 | I believe my verbal and written communication is strong - although I need to master the art of conciseness and poignancy. I've communicated regularly with developers up to VPs. I've presented to dozens or hundreds of people at internal business meetings and guilds, but have NOT done any conference speaking. I'm a sporadic [blogger](https://medium.com/@stephen-kawaguchi) but have written dozens of internal guides, standards, learning curricula, and primers. Topics include: Adopting [CUPID](https://dannorth.net/cupid-for-joyful-coding/), How to write tests, a software engineer's career growth roadmap, multiple SonarQube code quality guides, Consumer-Driven Contract Testing with Pactflow, Always-Shippable coding, a TDD internal conference talk, a TDD course, and how to formulate a microservice testing strategy. My favourite play is to take a problematic code component and rehabilitate it, and use my own code as examples of code smell identification, refactoring patterns, TDD/BDD, the application of design patterns, and other techniques. |
| **Craft** | 4 | 12 | When it comes to coding principles, I'm heavily influenced by Agile thought leaders. I advocate for software craft through discussion, instruction, and practice. I'm also always learning this topic more deeply through my own research and experimentation. topics like CUPID, SOLID and software simplicity. I've written code using TDD/BDD for 7+ years, leading to greater understanding of design and refactoring patterns. I push for better code quality metrics (beyond code coverage). I also make a point of providing extra knowledge in code reviews. Recently, I've been focused on improving my application of the Scientific Method, which is inspired by Lean Startup, The Art of Action, and other modes of work, while still delivering high-quality software. I've mostly "spoken" JavaScript and TypeScript, but am learning how to apply these lessons to Go. I've also been improving my knowledge of systems design of highly-distributed systems, and building upon my background in software architecture patterns with a goal of realizing evolutionary architectures in my systems. I feel that there are gaps that need to be bridged here between informal, intuitive design, and formal, ordered identification and protection of architecture characteristics via fitness functions that achieve business goals efficiently and effectively. |  
| **Initiative** | 3 | 6 | After a brief initial acclimatization stage, I've always thrown myself into the hardest or most valuable problems. At this point, I'm also wired to identify risk. After I do so, I advocate for preventative change, or simply put them in place as my normal order of business. Having been around onboarding practices and hiring practices, I would say that I've helped to significantly improve those activities in every organization I've been part of. Partly, it stems from Lean Management philosophies, and partly, it's a desire to create a psychologically safe environment from every teammate's Day One. From an engineering perspective, I refine and improve Agile methods through feedback and intention-setting, adoption of DevOps practices. I've led the charge from transitioning predilications for monoliths towards cloud-native, domain-aligned thinking to break down big, slow releases (and problems) into small, faster ones. I've also been deployed solve fundamental organizational problems, such as driving organizational adoption of TDD (John Deere), driving a Continuous Delivery mindset (IBM), and figuring out how to transition a high-profile but struggling team to greater levels of stability through coding practices, software engineering knowledge, and better architectures (Ada). Much of my work has been leading multiple teams with crippling architectural and technical debt levels and breaking down mindsets resistant to change, with facts (identifying broken systems), data (e.g. 90% bug reduction), and hands-on examples generally preferring to offer my own code up to provide lessons-learned. An area of growth for me is to exercise my autonomy more effectively and take steps to tackle the big problems nobody knows how to solve without asking for permission. |

| **Supporting** |
| **Career Development** | 3 | 6 | **Update:** As mentioned in other sections, moving to startups after 20+ years in enterprise, a new domain (ad tech), and moving fully to back-end platform development has been a huge shift. I'm very happy with the move and am learning a lot, but I haven't achieved enough to warrant a score change yet. I have, however, delivered things way outside of my normal areas, but until I manage a huge win for my organization, I believe my score stays the same. This one is hard, and I might be too harsh a judge. In terms of what _new_ things I've done in the past two years, a product vision doc, used The Startup Way/Scientific Method to drive technology choices, written production Go (Rails to come), researched and delivered an MVP API Gateway (Tyk) which is being used by one team with our biggest client, developed a real-time image transformation pipeline in AWS (CloudFront, Lambda, Lambda@Edge with experiments with API Gateway and S3). I've also made the shift to platform engineering to help deliver critical capabilities to other engineering teams. | 
| **Org Design** | 2 | 3 | I've been studying organizational design from the perspective of aligning teams to business domains for a while. I'm influenced by the Inverse Conway Maneuver,  Team Topologies, Systems Designs, the Spotify Model, and Domain Driven Design as an organizing concept for microservices. I've never led a re-org. Until I jump ladders to management, I probably won't be anything more than an interested advisor. Without having that kind of skin in the game, I'm not sure I'd really qualify as having a higher score. |
| **Wellbeing** | 3 | 6 | I work very hard to foster a learning culture in my area. I've co-founded multiple learning clubs across organizations, contributed to the IBM Agile Academy, given multiple internal talks, and worked to create collections of resources. I do this to ensure my teammates are constantly challenged to grow at their own pace. I also hunt down work I believe they will find interesting. My goal is for them to be engaged and have a safe space to ask questions and learn. I try to inject as much rigour into our work without being overbearing. I wouldn't say I'm a cultural leader - more of a positive contributor. I recognize that some managers and other leaders contribute much more to the overall environment than I do - especially when I'm in heavy learning mode. My other criticism is that I don't shake things up as much as I used to. Part of it is because as I've risen higher and shifted to smaller orgs (startups), my ability and opportunity to focus have seen a steep decline. I'm trying hard to work on this - it was the central point of my PD plan at my last job and a constant focus. I've mostly developed this by reading books revolving around how to be more impactful in terms of formulating and executing strategy: The Art of Action, Lean Startup/The Startup Way, Radical Focus, Escaping the Build Trap, Accelerate, Staff Engineer, The Art of Business Value, Atomic Habits, Algorithms to Live By, Think Again, Limitless, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and several others. My point is that I want to understand how to be a more effective person, and how to coach others (and parent my son) to be effective. **Update:** (+1/+3 Sep 2023) I've seen modest growth in this area. My learning has been paying off in terms of personal awareness, contentedness, ability to deliver, and ability to juggle more (by doing less!). |
| **Accomplishment** | 3 | 6 | **Update:** I've been doing more hands-on delivery in the past year and stretching my borders. No enough to warrant any score change in either direction. To recap, I wrote my first-ever product vision doc, jumped fully into the back-end (Go, Rails, MySQL, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, DynamoDB) and cloud-native (Tyk, AWS API Gateway, CloudFront, S3, Go Lambda, Lambda@Edge). I also went from two AI-focused product organizations (although NOT on an ML or AI team myself) to an ad tech company where my long-term focus will be geo-spatial computing. Previously, I've taken several teams from siloed and low-performing to exemplary within their product groups. For example, by using Lean / Agile / DevOps strategies, I was able to lead my current team to the highest SonarQube metrics and gating conditions across ~2,000 developers and to turn them into the only DevOps-capable team deploying at 6x the rest of the org in a group of ~100 developers. I've also used coaching to halt departures and drastically increase engagement. I've done this for years in different situations. |

| **Strengthening** |
| **Mentorship** | 4 | 12 | I've kept up mentorship relationships even after leaving big enterprises, and am pretty satisfied with my loose interpretation of Radical Candor-style 1:1s (with a focus on technology). Through 1:1s and informal mentorship, I've guided dozens of developers through their soft skills and software engineering knowledge growth. I'm very happy that many have moved on to leadership positions and/or pretty great organizations. I'm struggling to figure out how to scale these past 1:1s beyond inspiring my mentees to become mentors themselves. Update: Recently, I've worked with a few pretty amazing mentors, so I recognize that I have a lot to learn. I also feel like I'm not a very good mentee because I need to think harder about what I want to do and be more concise when I get 1:1 face time. I run Radical Candor style 1:1s for technical coaching with 7 developers currently and as many as 12 concurrent developers in the past. Most of my work has been with engineers, but I've also mentored architects and coached managers and executives.  | 
| **Evangelism** | 2 | 3 | I believe I've done a decent job of this, especially at my last company. I wrote a case study and several guides around the topic of software quality. My real aim was to find my Army of Change (from the [Kotter Change Model](https://www.kotterinc.com/methodology/8-steps/)) and find ways to empower them to drive change in their areas. However, these efforts took time I didn't end up having since a large portion of engineering was laid off. That would have been my biggest impact to date. Otherwise, I've helped teach many teams and individuals the value of software quality and engineering principles, or even how to work constructively. This probably isn't what this particular grade is for other than to  |
| **Recruiting** | 3 | 6 | I've been a hiring manager multiple times. I've conducted over 200 technical interviews and created an interviewing process. I've also built up multiple teams from scratch. **Update:** (+1/+3 Sep 2023) I've been part of hiring teams again, and have had a (small) hand in selling candidates on our culture, and taking the time to answer the questions behind their questions and creating a welcoming interview environment. I generally appeal to their desire for growth, and am pretty frank about the culture and opportunities in whichever org I'm working with. | 
| **Community** | 3 | 6 | I work hard to build bridges within my org. My main IBM product is a testament to that: my group had to work with 30+ groups - from dependencies, compliance/audit, and partnerships. There would be no chance of success if I hadn't brought all of my collaborative abilities to bear and run our product through the gauntlet. I also help foster a learning culture by giving occasional talks, leading and participating in study groups (DDD, Staff+ engineering, Kubernetes/cloud native, Clean Code) and guilds (Agile, Go), and sharing insights from my personal research with interested parties from developers, to managers, to exectives. I help other teams with their initiatives without sacrificing my own team's initiatives. I'm always hunting for win-win collaborations. |
