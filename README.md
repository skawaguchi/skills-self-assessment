# Skills Self-Rating

I was shown this tool while discussing software craftsmanship across IBM. I thought it would be an interesting exercise to see where I might stand myself, and also to use for my mentees in our 1:1s.

## Current Areas of Development

- **Foundation**: Continue to develop back-end and cloud-native hands-on. Also, improve system design skills.
- **Servers**: Build microservices and lambdas from the beginning. Learn Terraform and more GitOps.
- **Supporting**: Learn how to make game-changing impacts and grow my skills so I can contribute to the same degree as staff engineers and senior developers in a truly generative organization.
  
## Medium Engineering Growth Rubric

*Last Updated: Sep 1, 2023*
*Previous Update: January 31, 2021*

Refer to Medium's [Engineering growth: Introduction](https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework/engineering-growth-framework-overview-4e02ab330524) for more details. Here is the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EO-Dbsayn8Nz9Ii3MKcwRbt-EIJ2MjQdpoyhh0tBdZk/edit). Medium's [Snowflake](https://snowflake.medium.com/#1,4,3,1,4,3,4,3,3,2,2,3,4,2,1,3,Stephen%20Kawaguchi,Staff%20Engineer) can give you an idea of how the metrics work (although Medium itself has [evolved past using it](https://medium.engineering/engineering-growth-at-medium-4935b3234d25)). 

| Skill | Milestone | Points | Justification |
| :---- | --------: | -----: | ------------- |
| **Build** |
| Mobile | 1 | 1 | Experience with React Native. |
| Web Client | 3 | 6 | Long and deep experience with web clients and HTTP. Strong JavaScript knowledge, along with SPAs. Low-level performance optimization. **Update:** (-1/-6 Sep 2023) I've been away from this part of the stack for a while, and have noticed that I'm not up to date with important updates, so I've dropped my score here. | 
| Foundation | 3 | 6 | I've architected systems through major upgrades, including adjusting the architecture for better maintainability and extensibility. I've helped debug hard problems in all systems, including difficult optimizations. I've designed medium-complexity web apps. I'm still learning system design and particularly some distributed systems. However, I believe I know microservices architecture fairly well. |
| Servers | 2 | 3 | Recently, I've shifted to a back-end-heavy position and have been working with Go and some Rails. I'm not comfortable enough to have earned a higher score, yet. Previously, although I was primarily front-end, I had years of experience adjusting existing server-side code from ASP Classic, ASP.NET, Java, JSP, JSF, and Rails. |
| *Sub-Total* | 9 | **16** |  (-1/-6 Sep 2023) |
| **Executing** |
| Project Management | 4 | 12 | After moving to StaffPlus positions and a focused senior engineer role that these skills have remained intact. I've been able to navigate cross-team communication and complex delivery fairly well. I've also continued my study of leadership and management principles and have especially enjoyed seeing concepts like SixSigma connect in my study of Lean Management principles through DevOps. So, my previous experience has remained valuable and very much relevant. I've previously been a project and program manager for 4 years and led teams and engineering organizations for another 4 years. These skills transferred well to leading projects as a software architect. I enjoyed doing that without being part of the official chain of command but as an advisor and influencer. |  
| Communication | 3 | 6 | I've communicated with most levels of organizations - from developers to VPs. I've presented to dozens or hundreds of people at internal business meetings and guilds but haven't done any live public speaking (e.g., conference talks). I'm a sporadic [blogger](https://medium.com/@stephen-kawaguchi). I'm still working on being concise and to be more compelling overall. |
| Craft | 4 | 12 | I've been a strong advocate for software craft, by leading learning for topics like CUPID, SOLID, providing significant TDD'd code, leading the push for better code quality metrics than code coverage and providing knowledge in code reviews. The last couple of years, I've been focused on trying to understand how I can accommodate my more recent shift to applying the Scientific Method in the spirit of Lean Startup and other modes of work (vs. Agile Software methods), and still deliver high-quality work. I see this as a path to making high impacts, which I feel is a weakness coming from slow-moving enterprises (even after digital transformations). I'm also learning how to apply these lessons to Go, and, to a lesser extent, Ruby on Rails. My system design skills are also improving as I learn from really strong cloud architects. |
| Initiative | 3 | 6 | After a brief info-gathering stage, I'm always an outspoken advocate for necessary change. Other areas I've impacted include onboarding practices, hiring practices, Agile methods, DevOps practices, and leading the charge from transitioning an on-prem, monolithic product mindset to a cloud-native, microservices one. I've also been sent in to help solve fundamental organizational problems, such as converting an organization to TDD, driving a Continuous Delivery mindset, and figuring out how to transition a high-profile but struggling team to greater levels of stability. Much of my work has been leading multiple teams with crippling architectural and technical debt levels and breaking down mindsets resistant to change with facts and data. |

| **Supporting** |
| Career Development | 3 | 6 | **Update:** As mentioned in other sections, moving to startups after 20+ years in enterprise, a new domain (ad tech), and moving fully to back-end platform development has been a huge shift. I'm very happy with the move and am learning a lot, but I haven't achieved enough to warrant a score change yet. I have, however, delivered things way outside of my normal areas, but until I manage a huge win for my organization, I believe my score stays the same. This one is hard, and I might be too harsh a judge. In terms of what _new_ things I've done in the past two years, a product vision doc, used The Startup Way/Scientific Method to drive technology choices, written production Go (Rails to come), researched and delivered an MVP API Gateway (Tyk) which is being used by one team with our biggest client, developed a real-time image transformation pipeline in AWS (CloudFront, Lambda, Lambda@Edge with experiments with API Gateway and S3). I've also made the shift to platform engineering to help deliver critical capabilities to other engineering teams. | 
| Org Design | 2 | 3 | I've been studying organizational design from the perspective of aligning teams to business domains for a while. I'm influenced by the Inverse Conway Maneuver,  Team Topologies, Systems Designs, the Spotify Model, and Domain Driven Design as an organizing concept for microservices. I've never led a re-org. Until I jump ladders to management, I probably won't be anything more than an interested advisor. Without having that kind of skin in the game, I'm not sure I'd really qualify as having a higher score. |
| Wellbeing | 3 | 6 | I work very hard to foster a learning culture in my area. I've co-founded multiple learning clubs across organizations, contributed to the IBM Agile Academy, given multiple internal talks, and worked to create collections of resources. I do this to ensure my teammates are constantly challenged to grow at their own pace. I also hunt down work I believe they will find interesting. My goal is for them to be engaged and have a safe space to ask questions and learn. I try to inject as much rigour into our work without being overbearing. I wouldn't say I'm a cultural leader - more of a positive contributor. I recognize that some managers and other leaders contribute much more to the overall environment than I do - especially when I'm in heavy learning mode. My other criticism is that I don't shake things up as much as I used to. Part of it is because as I've risen higher and shifted to smaller orgs (startups), my ability and opportunity to focus have seen a steep decline. I'm trying hard to work on this - it was the central point of my PD plan at my last job and a constant focus. I've mostly developed this by reading books revolving around how to be more impactful in terms of formulating and executing strategy: The Art of Action, Lean Startup/The Startup Way, Radical Focus, Escaping the Build Trap, Accelerate, Staff Engineer, The Art of Business Value, Atomic Habits, Algorithms to Live By, Think Again, Limitless, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and several others. My point is that I want to understand how to be a more effective person, and how to coach others (and parent my son) to be effective. **Update:** (+1/+3 Sep 2023) I've seen modest growth in this area. My learning has been paying off in terms of personal awareness, contentedness, ability to deliver, and ability to juggle more (by doing less!). |
| Accomplishment | 3 | 6 | **Update:** I've been doing more hands-on delivery in the past year and stretching my borders. No enough to warrant any score change in either direction. To recap, I wrote my first-ever product vision doc, jumped fully into the back-end (Go, Rails, MySQL, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, DynamoDB) and cloud-native (Tyk, AWS API Gateway, CloudFront, S3, Go Lambda, Lambda@Edge). I also went from two AI-focused product organizations (although NOT ML or AI team myself) to an ad tech company. Previously, I've taken several teams from siloed and low-performing to exemplary within their product groups. For example, by using Lean / Agile / DevOps strategies, I was able to lead my current team to the highest SonarQube metrics and gating conditions across ~2,000 developers and to turn them into the only DevOps-capable team deploying at 6x the rest of the org in a group of ~100 developers. I've also used coaching to halt departures and drastically increase engagement. I've done this for years in different situations. |

| **Strengthening** |
| Mentorship | 4 | 12 | I've kept up mentorship relationships even after leaving big enterprises, and am pretty satisfied with my loose interpretation of Radical Candor-style 1:1s (with a focus on technology). Through 1:1s and informal mentorship, I've guided dozens of developers through their soft skills and software engineering knowledge growth. I'm very happy that many have moved on to leadership positions and/or pretty great organizations. I'm struggling to figure out how to scale these past 1:1s beyond inspiring my mentees to become mentors themselves. Update: Recently, I've worked with a few pretty amazing mentors, so I recognize that I have a lot to learn. I also feel like I'm not a very good mentee because I need to think harder about what I want to do and be more concise when I get 1:1 face time. I run Radical Candor style 1:1s for technical coaching with 7 developers currently and as many as 12 concurrent developers in the past. Most of my work has been with engineers, but I've also mentored architects and coached managers and executives.  | 
| Evangelism | 2 | 3 | I believe I've done a decent job of this, especially at my last company. I wrote a case study and several guides around the topic of software quality. My real aim was to find my Army of Change (from the [Kotter Change Model](https://www.kotterinc.com/methodology/8-steps/)) and find ways to empower them to drive change in their areas. However, these efforts took time I didn't end up having since a large portion of engineering was laid off. That would have been my biggest impact to date. Otherwise, I've helped teach many teams and individuals the value of software quality and engineering principles, or even how to work constructively. This probably isn't what this particular grade is for other than to  |
| Recruiting | 3 | 6 | I've been a hiring manager multiple times. I've conducted over 200 technical interviews and created an interviewing process. I've also built up multiple teams from scratch. **Update:** (+1/+3 Sep 2023) I've been part of hiring teams again, and I believe I've had a small hand in convincing candidates to accept offers by taking the time to answer the questions behind their questions and creating a welcoming interview environment. I generally appeal to their desire for growth, and am pretty frank about the culture and opportunities in whichever org I'm working with. | 
| Community | 3 | 6 | I work hard to build bridges. My last project is a testament to that because my group had to work with over 30 groups on various topics. There would be no chance of success if we hadn't brought all of our collaborative abilities to bear. Additionally, I participate in org-wide discussions and help foster a learning culture by giving occasional talks and participating in our Learning Club and Agile Guild. **Update:** While I've stepped back from this at my current job, I'm still building relationships across teams where I see siloing and lack of information flow as being dangerous to our initiatives. So, I've redirected my energy from more visible things like guilds or all-hands talks towards building stronger information pipelines and trust between teams that need each other to succeed. This is a nod towards my move to platform engineering-oriented teams. |
